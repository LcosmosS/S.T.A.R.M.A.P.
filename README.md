## Vision

**S.T.A.R.M.A.P.** is the applied mapping and visualization engine of the S.T.A.R. Labs Research Program. It aims to generate high-fidelity, dynamically evolving **topographical maps** of the observable universe by projecting deep arithmetic invariants of elliptic curves onto cosmic geometry, modulated by entropy cohomology fields, and rendered through persistent homology and symbolic regression.

These maps will reveal the large-scale structure — **filaments, voids, clusters, gravitational density variations, and cosmic radiation patterns** — not as random outcomes of inflation, but as the deterministic geometric shadow of an underlying **Symbolic Field**.

## Core Objectives

- Produce multi-layered 3D/4D maps of the cosmic web using arithmetic projections.
- Integrate entropy cohomology for dynamical evolution and radiation density.
- Enable scale-dependent cosmological features, including the effective Hubble parameter $\(H_{\rm eff}(z)\)$.
- Support manifold analysis through **S.M.A.T.** (S.T.A.R. Manifold Analysis Tool similar to NASA's G.M.A.T. but adapted for an arithmetic manifold)

## Mapping Architecture

### Input Layer — Arithmetic Data
- Elliptic curves from Cremona and LMFDB databases $(\(\Delta_E\), \(N_E\), \(r_E\), \({Reg}(E)\), \(\Omega_E\))$.
- Isogeny class information and torsion structure.
- Real period $\(\Omega_E\)$ as the fundamental “clock” for expansion.

### Projection Layer — ACSC (Arithmetic–Cosmic Structure Conjecture)
The core projection map 

$\Phi: \mathcal{E} \to M_{\rm cosmo}\$ 

is defined as:

$\Phi(E)$ = $\bigl( \sin\phi_E \cos\theta_E,\ \sin\phi_E \sin\theta_E,\ \cos\phi_E,\ \rho_E,\ \lambda_E \bigr),\$

where

$\theta_E = 2\pi \frac{\log|\Delta_E|}{1 + \log(1 + |\Delta_E|)} , \quad \phi_E = \pi \frac{\log N_E}{1 + \log(1 + N_E)}\$,

$\rho_E = \frac{2}{\pi} \arctan(r_E) , \quad \lambda_E = \frac{\log(1 + {Reg}(E))}{1 + \log(1 + {Reg}(E))}.\$

Optional **dynamic topological corrections** are applied:
- Sinusoidal transformations to reduce polar clustering.
- Oblate flattening constraints.
- Force-directed geodesic repulsion for uniform distribution.

### Dynamics Layer — ECC (Entropy Cohomology)
- An entropy field $\(\mathcal{M}(x)\)$ evolves on the projected manifold.
- Persistent homology (via Gudhi) computes Betti numbers, persistence entropy, and topological invariants at multiple scales.
- Isogeny flows shift effective scale factors: $\(g_{E'}(t) = g_E(t) + \eta \log m\)$.

### Cosmological Layer — Effective Expansion
The scale-dependent effective Hubble parameter is:

$H_{\rm eff}(z) = H_0 \cdot \langle \Omega_E \rangle_z,\$

where

$\langle \Omega_E \rangle_z = \frac{\sum_E w_E(z) \, \Omega_E}{\sum_E w_E(z)}\$

and weights $\(w_E(z)\)$ are determined by:
- Projection distortions and local/global sampling bias.
- Isogeny class density.
- Local density after topological corrections.

This produces naturally different expansion rates at low $\(z\)$ (local ladder) and high $\(z\)$ (CMB), offering a potential number-theoretic resolution to the Hubble tension.

### Visualization & Mission Layer — S.M.A.T. Integration
- 3D/4D rendering of density fields, filaments, voids, and radiation patterns.
- Overlay of gravitational potential and entropy gradients.
- Export formats compatible with mission planning tools (trajectories, communication windows, risk assessment based on topological stability).

## Implementation Status

- **Projection Engine**: Fully implemented in `src/acsc/` and `src/projection/`.
- **TDA Pipeline**: Persistent homology and entropy computation in `src/tda/`.
- **Symbolic Regression**: Parameter discovery and law refinement in `src/symbolic_regression/`.
- **Hubble Tension Module**: Scale-dependent \(H_{\rm eff}(z)\) fitting in `notebooks/hubble_tension_fit.ipynb`.
- **Data Pipeline**: Cremona + LMFDB processing with parallel support.
- **Visualization**: Early support in `src/blender/` and `src/visualization/`.

## Testable Predictions & Validation

- Persistent homology of the projected point cloud $\(\{\Phi(E)\}\)$ should reproduce key CMB anomalies (low quadrupole suppression, hemispherical asymmetry, cold spot topology).
- Early vs. late subsamples (binned by $\(\nu_E\)$ or $\(\delta_E\))$ should exhibit measurable topological differences consistent with observed $\(H(z)\)$ discrepancies.
- Generated topographical maps should show self-consistent filament/void structure matching large-scale surveys (SDSS, DESI, Euclid).

## Future Development Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Full projection + TDA pipeline, basic 3D maps, Hubble tension validation.  
**Phase 2**: Dynamic time evolution with entropy cohomology, symbolic law refinement.  
**Phase 3**: High-resolution S.T.A.R.M.A.P. maps and integration with S.M.A.T. for mission planning.  
**Phase 4**: Public release of interactive cosmic maps and open-source mission analysis toolkit.

**S.T.A.R.M.A.P.** transforms abstract number theory into concrete, explorable maps of the cosmos — and ultimately into practical tools for humanity’s expansion beyond Earth.
